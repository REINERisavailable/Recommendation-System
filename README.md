## ðŸ“– Introduction

This project aims to implement and compare various recommendation algorithms. From traditional methods like collaborative and content-based filtering to advanced techniques involving neural networks and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we explore how different models can be utilized to suggest movies to users based on their historical preferences and the characteristics of the movies themselves.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implements user-based and item-based collaborative filtering to recommend movies by finding similar users or items.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses movie metadata (e.g., genres) to recommend movies similar to what the user likes.
- **Neural Collaborative Filtering**: Leverages deep learning to predict user preferences for unseen movies.
- **GAN-Based Recommendation**: Employs a GAN architecture to generate novel movie recommendations.
